Default JavaScript Behavior:--

JavaScript -> 1. Synchronous ( Synchronous means one thing at a time then other thing like : one by one execution)
              2. Single Threaded  

<+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++>

synchronous (async) code in JavaScript allows certain tasks to run in the background without blocking the rest of the code execution. This is useful for operations like:

 âœ… Fetching data from an API
 âœ… Reading files
 âœ… Waiting for user input
 âœ… Delaying execution (setTimeout)

 <-----------Synchronous vs Asynchronous Code------------------>

 Synchronous (Blocking) Code
 Executes line by line.
 Waits for one task to finish before moving to the next.            */

console.log("Step 1");
console.log("Step 2"); 
console.log("Step 3");

/* Output:
 Step 1
 Step 2
 Step 3
 ðŸ‘‰ Each step runs in order, waiting for the previous one.

 Asynchronous (Non-Blocking) Code
 Doesn't wait for tasks to complete.
 Moves on to the next task while waiting for a response.          */

console.log("Step 1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Step 2 (after 2 seconds)");
}, 2000); // Runs after 2 seconds

console.log("Step 3");

/* Output:
 Step 1
 Step 3
 Step 2 (after 2 seconds)
 ðŸ”¹ Why?

 setTimeout is asynchronous. It schedules the function but does not block the next line.
 Step 3 runs immediately, while Step 2 waits for 2 seconds.                 */


 console.log("Step 1");

 setTimeout(() => {
   console.log("Step 2");
 },0); // Runs after 2 seconds
 
 console.log("Step 3");

 /* Output:
 Step 1
 Step 3
 Step 2

note : because step 2 in is Asynchronous Code so it is in web API then goes in task Queue and goes in call stack then print

/* How to Handle Asynchronous Code?
There are three main ways to handle async code in JavaScript:

1. Callbacks (Old Method)
A function passed as an argument to another function, which runs after the async task completes.

function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Data fetched!");
    callback();
  }, 2000);
}

fetchData(() => {
  console.log("Processing Data...");
});
Problem: Callbacks can lead to "callback hell" when there are multiple nested callbacks.

2. Promises (Better Way)
A Promise represents a value that will be available in the future.

let fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Data fetched!");
  }, 2000);
});

fetchData.then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
âœ… Promises avoid callback hell and make the code cleaner.

3. Async/Await (Best Way)
A modern, cleaner way to write async code.

async function fetchData() {
  console.log("Fetching data...");
  let response = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched!"), 2000);
  });
  console.log(response);
}

fetchData();
âœ… Easier to read and write compared to Promises.

Conclusion:
Method	                   Description
Callback	       Older method, leads to callback hell
Promise	           Handles async operations better
Async/Await	       Best way, makes async code look like sync */
