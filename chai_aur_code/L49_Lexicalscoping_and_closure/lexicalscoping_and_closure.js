// <-------------------------------Closure------------------------------------------>
// A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and it 'remembers' the variables from the outer function â€” even after the outer function has finished executing.
// A closure is a function that remembers variables from where it was created, even if you call it somewhere else.
